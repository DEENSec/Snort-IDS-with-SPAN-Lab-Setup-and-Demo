# Snort-IDS-with-SPAN-Lab-Setup-and-Demo
This lab demonstrates how to set up Snort IDS using a SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) port for real-time traffic monitoring. We configured Snort to capture mirrored network traffic, detect suspicious activity, and generate alerts, simulating a real-world intrusion detection scenario.
